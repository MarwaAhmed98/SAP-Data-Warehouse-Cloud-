# SAP-Data-Warehouse-Cloud-
A repository to get hands-on experience with SAP DWC and build your first Data Warehouse

## Prerequisites:
SAP Data Warehouse Cloud 30-day free trial account

This guide is divided into six modules, by the end of the six modules you should be able to do the following:
* Implement data governance measures by assigning users to roles and define access for each user respectively
* Add more users in bulk as you scale your data warehouse across the organization
* Create spaces and assign users to spaces
* Establish remote connections and load data from SAP HANA and upload local files to the cloud
* Build ER models to define relationships between datasets
* Construct a basic data model in graphical view
* Build an analytical dataset with defined *Measures* and *Dimensions*
* Add business information to semantic layer
* Create interactive data stories


## Important keywords to define:


spaces: these are virtual workspaces for an individual or a group of users for data modeling, data integration, and story dashboard building. Think of them as your isolated business functions such as Marketing, HR, Finance, Business Development, etc. 

### Module 1: Data Governance Measures and Spaces
Navigate to *Security* and click on Users. You should have a table to add users and their respectives roles. Note that only one **system owner** can be assigned to each data warehouse. The license is a feature to manage the number of concurrent users logging into the data warehouse. You can adjust it if needed.

Navigate to *Space Management* and add a space called Bike Run Sales. The space can be assigned quotas for available disc space, CPU usage, runtime hours, and memory usage. There are useful icons at the top to indcate if one space is overused or underused. 



### Module 2: Data Ingestion
In the same space, nagivate to *Connections*. Click the âž• icon to add a connection. You can add a connection to an existing SAP HANA database if you are using it. Else, you can manually upload the excel files. Note that you can also add a connection to any ETL tool that speaks SQL using the *Open SQL Schemas*. <br/>
For local file uploads, navigate to *Data Builder* and create a table. You can upload CSV file directly but that didn't work for me. After creating the table, add business purpose of the table to keep some metadata and add columns as necessary. You can define data types and any constraint related to each column. Click on *Save* and *Deploy*. Note that the upload will only be available after you deploy the table. 




### Module 3: Build ER Model
Navigate back to the *Data Builder*, Go to *E/R models*. Click on New Entity Relationship Model to create one. On the left, there will find a list of all the tables uplaoded in the previous step under the *Repositories* tab .<br/>
Drag and drop the tables to connect Sales_Orders dataset to Sales_Order_Items and create the asscoiation based on the SalesOrderID. Repeat the same process for Sales_Orders, Business_Partners dataset and Addresses dataset and create the association based on the common keys, PartnerID and AddressID, respectively. Click on save and deploy to make the model available for use in the next step.
